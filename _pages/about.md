Hi, I am AmirHossein DabiriAghdam, a first-year master's student at the University of British Columbia ECE department, advised by Prof. Wang. I hold a BSc in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and their real-world applications. 

I also did an internship at EPFL LTS4 lab, where I had the great pleasure to work with Prof. Frossard on adversarial attacks against neural networks. 

Feel free to reach out, I am interested in collaborations and discussions in the exciting realm of AI/ML.
