Hello, I am AmirHossein Dabiri Aghdam (Written as *امیرحسین دبیری اقدم* in Persian), a senior undergraduate Electrical Engineering student at the ECE department of the University of Tehran. I am also minoring in Computer Engineering. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and their applications in natural language processing and computer vision. Last summer I did an internship at EPFL, where I had the great pleasure to work with Prof. Pascal Frossard and Dr. Sahar Sadrizadeh on adversarial attacks against neural networks.
