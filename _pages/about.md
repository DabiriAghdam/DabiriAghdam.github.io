Hi there! 👋 My name is AmirHossein DabiriAghdam (<span class="persian-name">امیرحسین دبیری اقدم</span>), but you can call me Amir! 😊 I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)](https://www.ubc.ca/), where I am co-supervised by [Prof. Giuseppe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini/) and [Prof. Lele Wang](https://ece.ubc.ca/lele-wang/). 

I hold a M.A.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UBC as well, and a B.Sc. degree from the [University of Tehran](https://ut.ac.ir/en). During my undergrad, I also did an internship at [EPFL LTS4 lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/), where I  had the privilege of working with [Prof. Pascal Frossard](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.frossard) on adversarial attacks against neural machine translation models. 🌍

My research interests span machine learning, deep learning, reinforcement learning, and their practical applications in natural language processing. Currently, I am particularly focused on leveraging LLMs as agents for decision-making. 🤖
